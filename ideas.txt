* periodically do an bluetooth LE scan with hcitool lescan to see if the RTL
  radar is in the list

* start recording if it's in the list and keep recording until it disappears
  from the list

* assuming the radar maintains an LE connection when Garmin is powered up and
  drops it when garmin is powered down

* add RTL address to whitelist and only scan whitelist - specify random
  address
  hcitool lewadd --random <baddr>
